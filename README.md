An application that returns the second biggest number

- **Version 1.0.0**

---

## What This Is

- An application using Java able to iterate over integers 
  and returns 2nd biggest element on that structure.

---

## Structure Explained
- **Java code is structured into three main packages**

  <br>

  - **(1) calculation** ðŸ Š Follows BCE Archetype.
    
    - **(a) boundary** ðŸ Š Any access to a functionality implemented in calculation package should be through the boundary layer.
      - NumChecker Interface ðŸ Š Has One method.
        - findMaxTwoIntegersGateway ðŸ Š Takes **FileParser parser** as an argument and returns **Result** Object.
      - NumCheckerImpl ðŸ Š Implements NumChecker Interface.
        - getLargestTwoNumbersAggregateGateway ðŸ Š Only purpose is to call **getLargestTwoNumbersAggregate()** method
          located in **NumCheckerCtrl** Class, because as mentioned we need to access method from the boundary layer.

    <br>
    
    - **(b) control** ðŸ Š Result calculations are performed in this control package.
      - NumCheckerCtrl ðŸ Š Has two private methods and one public method that can be accessed through boundary layer.
        - getLargestTwoNumbersAggregate ðŸ Š Handles the following scenarios:
          - If chunk being processed is empty then it breaks, else it gets the largest two numbers in this processedChunk.
          - If currentChunkResult is empty then I set it with newChunkResult which has the highest two integers.
          - If currentChunkResult is not empty then I get the largest two number from current and next chunks.
        - getLargestNumberFromTwoChunks ðŸ Š Private method called in getLargestTwoNumbersAggregate().
          - Takes two arguments of type **Result** two compare between them and gets largest two numbers.
          - If one of the two chunks being passed are null then we return the other.
          - Finally, we save both Result obj in a Collection that is then sent to getLargestTwoNumbers() to return a 
            single Result obj with the two biggest numbers out of both chunks
        - findMaxTwoIntegers ðŸ Š Private method called in getLargestNumberFromTwoChunks(). 
          - Searches **Collection<Integer>** and sets the **Result** obj with the highest and
          second highest number. If the collection passed is Empty it will return null and if the collection
          has only one element then it will set the **Result's maxNum** attribute with that single number
    
    <br>
            
    - **(c) entity** ðŸ Š Objects/Models used are placed in this package
      - Result ðŸ Š Result Object with two attributes to represent biggest and second biggest number.
        - maxNum ðŸ Š Is set with the biggest number.
        - secondMaxNum ðŸ Š Is set with the second biggest number.
        - toList() ðŸ Š makes sure that none of the maxNum, and the secondMaxNum attributes are null 
          before adding them to a **Collection<Integer>**
  
    <br>
  
  - **(2) reader** ðŸ Š Has One File Parse Interface and Two Classes that implement it.
    - FileParse Interface ðŸ Š Contains two methods.
        - loadFile ðŸ Š Finds and loads **DemoFile.txt** from **src/main/resources/DemoFile.txt**.
        - getNextChunk ðŸ Š Reads file chunk by chunk and returns **Collection<Integer>**.
    - FileParseImpl ðŸ Š Implements FileParser interface.
      - loadFile ðŸ Š Uses bufferReader and passes path of file in constructor to be sort of dynamic. 
      - getNextChunk ðŸ Š Reads file chunk by chunk and returns **Collection<Integer>** 
        chunkSize is static for now and has a value of **1000**.
    - FileParserMock ðŸ Š Implements FileParser interface and is used for testing purpose.
      - FileParserMock ðŸ Š Constructor takes an dummyChunk of type**ArrayList<Collection<Integer>>**  .
      - loadFile ðŸ Š Resets nextChunkPointer to Zero.
      - getNextChunk ðŸ Š returns chunk that the nextChunkPointer is pointing to.  
  
    <br>
  
  - **(3) runner** ðŸ Š Has the AppRunner Class that contains the main method to run the app. 
    - Main method code in AppRunner does three things:
      - Loads File from path.
      - Finds the Overall Largest Two Numbers.
      - Prints Second Highest Number.

## How To Use
- Build and Run Tests ðŸ Š **mvn clean install**
- Run Tests Only ðŸ Š **mvn test**
- Run App ðŸ Š You can run the app by running the main method in AppRunner class
<br>
    - located at **src/main/java/com/adsquare/example/runner/AppRunner.java**
- The input is being read from a txt file called "DemoFile.txt"
<br>
    - located at **src/main/resources/DemoFile.txt**

## Technologies used
- Java 11
- Maven
- Junit
- BufferedReader

---

## Improvements
- Can change chunk size to be configurable by reading it from an application.properties file.
- Adding Integration Test for the boundary layer
